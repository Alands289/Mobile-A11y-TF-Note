<h1>M016: Vertical navigation mechanisms for narrow width screens</h1>
<h2>User Problem</h2>
<p>
many websites are designed for a desktop viewing experience. Seen on the narrow display of a mobile device, this means that the browser's viewport shows just a part of the content. The width of content elements like horizontal menus often exceeds the width of display. On sites that are not responsive, this necessitates horizontal panning in order to activate menu items that are not within the current viewport.
</p>

<h2>Solution & Examples </h2>
<p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) can alleviate this problem by offering a navigation menu in different formats depending on the  actual width of the device screen (technically, the width of the browser viewport(). A menu that is shown as horizontal band in a desktop browser can be shown as vertical list onto the narrow screen of a mobile device.</p>

<p>The RWD approach uses so-called break points (CSS 3 @media selectors) that define different content renderings for specific ranges of viewport widths. Designers often use breakpoints to define different site layouts for the desktop, for tablets, and for smartphones.</p> 

<p>A very common RWD pattern is to render the main navigation menu as single  menu toggle button on narrow viewports. The aim is to ensure that main content stays visible even ion small screens. Toggling this menu button then expands the maim menu as a vertical list of options.</p>

<h3>Requirements for implementations</h3>
<p><strong>Note: The following list of requirements is probably incomplete and possibly inaccurate n places. It needs vetting by web designers and testing with different input scenarios lile mobile screen readers and mobile with connected keyboards.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the toggle button receives focus in keyboard operating modes as well as for keyboard and touch interaction with screenreader turned on.</li>
<li>Ensure thhat the menu toggle button has a meaningful accessible name</li>
<li>Ensure that the accessible name of the toggle button reflects the current state of the menu (collapsed/expanded) using aria-expanded attribute on the button</li>
<li>Ensure a focus order where the menu items in the expanded navigation menu immeadiately follow the toggle button(either by implementing this order in the dom or by dynamically setting the focus to the menu when it is expanded (note that this may not work well in all contexts)</li>
<li>Ensure that menu items can be focused and activated</li>
<li>To be checked: When the menu is displayed, use aria-hidden=true on the rest of the content to make the navigation menu work as a modal menu (and set aria-hidden on the rest of cvontent to false when the menu is collapsed</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example 1</h3>

(I have send a message to Bart Siomons to ask whether we can use the anysufer code example here. The example has the menu visible by default, to be toggled by a "hamburger" button. Wwe might modify the example to bring it in line with the much more common use with the collapsed state as default - but there are probably accessibility issues with this - so we need to be certain not propagete badly accessible design here...)
