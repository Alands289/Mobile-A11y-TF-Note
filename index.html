      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>This document provides informative guidance (but does not set   requirements) with regard to interpreting and applying Web Content   Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 [WCAG20] to web and non-web mobile   content and applications. </p>
      <p>While the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s W3C Web Accessibility   Initiative (WAI) is primarily concerned with web technologies, guidance   for web-based technologies is also often relevant to non-web   technologies. The W3C-WAI has published the Note <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/">Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)</a> to provide authoritative guidance on how to apply WCAG to non-web   technologies such as mobile native applications. The current document is   a mobile-specific extension of this effort. </p>
      <p>W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/">Mobile Web Initiative</a> Recommendations and Notes pertaining to mobile technologies also include the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp">Mobile Web Best Practices</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp">Mobile Web Application Best Practices</a>.   These offer general guidance to developers on how to create content and   applications that work well on mobile devices. The current document is   focused on the accessibility of mobile web and applications to people   with disabilities and is not intended to supplant any other W3C work. </p>
      <h3>WCAG 2.0 and Mobile Content/Applications></h3>
      <p><em>"Mobile"</em> is a generic term for a broad range of wireless   devices and applications that are easy to carry and use in a wide   variety of settings, including outdoors. Mobile devices range from small   handheld devices (e.g. feature phones, smartphones) to somewhat larger   tablet devices. The term also applies to <em>"wearables"</em> such as   "smart"-glasses, "smart"-watches and fitness bands,, and is relevant to   other small computing devices such as those embedded into car   dashboards, airplane seatbacks, and household appliances. </p>
      <p>While mobile is viewed by some as separate from <em>"desktop/laptop"</em>,   and thus perhaps requiring new and different accessibility guidance, in   reality there is no absolute divide between the categories. For   example: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>many desktop/laptop devices now include touchscreen gesture control, </li>
        <li>many mobile devices can be connected to an external keyboard and mouse, </li>
        <li>web pages utilizing responsive design can transition into a "mobile" screen size even on a desktop/laptop, and </li>
        <li>mobile operating systems have been used for laptop devices. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Furthermore, the vast majority of user interface patterns from   desktop/laptop systems (e.g. text, hyperlinks, tables, buttons, pop-up   menus, etc.) are equally applicable to mobile. Therefore, it's not   surprising that a large number of existing WCAG 2.0 techniques can be   applied to mobile content and applications (see Appendix A). Overall, <strong>WCAG 2.0 is highly relevant to both web and non-web mobile content and applications</strong>. </p>
      <p>That said, mobile devices do present a mix of accessibility   issues that are different from the typical desktop/laptop. The   "Discussion of Mobile-Related Issues" section, below, explains how these   issues can be addressed in the context of WCAG 2.0 as it exists or with   additional best practices. All the advice in this document can be   applied to mobile web sites, mobile web applications, and hybrid   web-native applications. Most of the advice also applies to native   applications (also known as "mobile apps"). </p>
      <p><em>Note:</em> WCAG 2.0 does not provide testable success criteria   for some of the mobile-related issues. The work of the Mobile   Accessibility Task Force has been to develop techniques and best   practices in these areas. When the techniques or best practices don't   map to specific WCAG success criteria, they aren't given a sufficient,   advisory or failure designation. This doesn't mean that they are   optional for creating accessible web content on a mobile platform, but   rather that they cannot currently be assigned a designation. The Task   Force anticipates that some of these techniques will be included as   sufficient or advisory in a potential future iteration of WCAG. </p>
      <p>The current document references existing WCAG 2.0 Techniques that   apply to mobile platform (see Appendix A) and provides new best   practices, which may in the future become WCAG 2.0 Techniques that   directly address emerging mobile accessibility challenges such as small   screens, touch and gesture interface, and changing screen orientation. </p>
      <h2>Other W3C-WAI Guidelines Related to Mobile</h2>
      <h3>UAAG 2.0 and Accessible Mobile Browsers</h3>
      <p>The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0 [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">UAAG2</a>]   is meant for the developers of user agents (e.g. web browsers and media   players), whether for desktop/laptop or mobile operating systems. A   user agent that follows UAAG 2.0 will improve accessibility through its   own user interface and through its ability to communicate with other   technologies, including assistive technologies. </p>
      <p>To assist developers of mobile browsers, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20-Reference/">UAAG 2.0 Reference</a> support document contains numerous mobile examples. These examples are also available in a separate list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IMPLEMENTING-UAAG20/mobile">mobile-related examples</a>, maintained by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG)</a>. </p>
      <h3>ATAG 2.0 and Accessible Mobile Authoring Tools</h3>
      <p>The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">ATAG2</a>]   provides guidelines for the developers of authoring tools, whether for   desktop/laptop or mobile operating systems. An authoring tool that   follows ATAG 2.0 will be both more accessible to authors with   disabilities (Part A) and designed to enable, support, and promote the   production of more accessible web content by all authors (Part B). </p>
      <p>To assist developers of mobile authoring tools, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20/">Implementing ATAG 2.0</a> support document contains numerous mobile authoring tool examples. </p>

    <h2>Discussion of Mobile-Related Issues</h2>
    <h3>Mobile accessibility considerations primarily related to Principle 1: Perceivable</h3>
    <h4>Small Screen Size</h4>
    <p>Small screen size is one of the most common characteristics of mobile devices. While the exceptional resolution of these screens theoretically enables large amounts of information to be rendered, the small size of the screen places practical limits on how much information people can actually view at one time, especially when magnification is used by people with low vision. </p>
    <p>Some best practices for helping users to make the most of small screens include </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Minimizing the amount of information that is put on each page compared to desktop/laptop versions by providing a dedicated mobile version or a responsive design: 
    	<ul>
        	<li>a dedicated mobile version contains content tailored for mobile use. For example, the content may contain fewer content modules, fewer images, or focus on important mobile usage scenarios. </li>
        	<li>a responsive design contains content that stays the same, but CSS   stylesheets are used to render it differently depending on the viewport   width. For example, on narrow screens the navigation menus may be hidden   until the user taps a menu button. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Providing a reasonable default size for content and touch controls (see "B.2 Touch Target Size and Spacing") to minimize the need to zoom in and out for users with low vision. </li>
    <li> Adapting the length of link text to the viewport width. </li>
    <li> Positioning form fields below, rather than beside, their labels (in portrait layout) </li>
    </ul>
    
<h4>Zoom/Magnification</h4>
<p>A variety of methods allow the user to control content size on mobile devices with small screens. At the browser level these methods are generally available to assist a wide audience of users. At the platform level these methods are available as accessibility features to serve people with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities.</p>

<p>The methods include the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>OS-level features
    <ul>
      <li> Set default text size (typically controlled from the Display Settings) <em>Note</em>: System text size is often not supported by mobile browsers. </li>
      <li> Magnify entire screen (typically controlled from the Accessibility Settings). <em>Note</em>: Using this setting requires the user to pan vertically and horizontally. </li>
      <li> Magnifying lens view under user's finger (typically controlled from the Accessibility Settings) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Browser-level features
    <ul>
      <li> Set default text size of text rendered in the browser's viewport
        <ul>
          <li> Reading mode that renders main content at a user-specified text size </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Magnify browser's viewport (typically "pinch-zoom"). <em>Note</em>: Using this setting requires the user to pan vertically and horizontally.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Note</em>: Some browsers have features that might modify this type   of magnification (e.g. re-flowing the content at the new magnification   level, overriding author attempts to prevent pinch-zoom). </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The WCAG 2.0 success criterion that is most related to zoom/magnification is </p>
  
  <ul><li><strong>1.4.4 Resize text</strong> (Level AA) </li></ul>
  
<p>SC 1.4.4 requires text to be resizable without assistive technology up to 200 percent. To meet this requirement content must not prevent text magnification by the user. </p>
<p>The following methods might be used: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that the browser pinch zoom is not blocked by the page's   viewport meta element so that it can be used to zoom the page to 200%.   Restrictive values for user-scalable and maximum-scale attributes of   this meta element should be avoided. <em>Note:</em> Relying on full   viewport zooming (e.g. not blocking the browser's pinch zoom feature)   requires the user to pan horizontally as well as vertically.  While this   technique meets the success criteria it is less usable than supporting   text resizing features that reflow content to the user's chosen viewport   size.  It is best practice to use techniques that support text resizing   without requiring horizontal panning. </li>
  <li>Support for system fonts that follow platform level user preferences for text size. </li>
  <li>Provide on-page controls to change the text size. </li>
  </ul>
<p>Accessibility features geared toward specific populations of people with   disabilities fall under the definition of assistive technology adopted   by WCAG and thus cannot be relied upon to meet the success criteria.    For example, a platform-level zoom feature that magnifies all platform   content and has features to specifically support people with low vision   is likely considered an assistive technology. </p>

<h4>Contrast</h4>
<p>Mobile devices are more likely than desktop/laptop devices to be used in   varied environments including outdoors, where glare from the sun or   other strong lighting sources is more likely.  This scenario heightens   the importance of use of good contrast for all users and may compound   the challenges that users with low vision have accessing content with   poor contrast on mobile devices. </p>
<p>The WCAG 2.0 success criteria related to the issue of contrast are: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</strong> (Level AA) which requires a contrast of at least 4.5:1 (or 3:1 for large-scale text) and </li>
  <li> <strong>1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)</strong> (Level AAA) which requires a contrast of at least 7:1 (or 4.5:1 for large-scale text). </li>
</ul>
<p>SC 1.4.3. allows for different contrast ratios for large text.    Allowing different contrast ratios for larger text is useful because   larger text with wider character strokes is easier to read at a lower   contrast.  This allows designers more leeway for contrast of larger   text, which is helpful for content such as titles.  The ratio of   18-point text or 14-point bold text described in the SC 1.4.3 was judged   to be large enough to enable a lower contrast ratio for web pages   display on a 15-inch monitor at 1024x768 resolution with a 24-inch   viewing distance.  Mobile device content is viewed on smaller screens   and in different conditions so this allowance for lessened contrast on   large text must be considered carefully for mobile apps. </p>
<p>For instance, the default point size for mobile platforms might   be larger than the default point size used on non-mobile devices. When   determining which contrast ratio to follow, developers should strive to   make sure to apply the lessened contrast ratio only when text is roughly   equivalent to 1.2 times bold or 1.5 times (120% bold or 150%) that of   the default platform size.  Note, however, that the use of text that is   1.5 times the default on mobile platforms does not imply that the text   will be readable by a person with low vision. People with low vision   will likely need and use additional platform level accessibility   features and assistive technology such as increased text size and zoom   features to access mobile content. </p>
